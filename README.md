# dynamic-page
## the dynamic-page named files
These files encompass a project that combines the use of js, HTML,and php to create a webpage that would hypothetically take in a order for a t-shirt and would relay the size, color, and image to a database. My teacher also brought in a period of time where we worked with MySQL before he got disctracted and the whole project was scrapped.
## the web graphic files
These files hold a series of experimental projects that play with js and the creation of animation on a webpage.
