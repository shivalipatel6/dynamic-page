# dynamic-page
This repository holds a highschool project that combined use of js, HTML,and php to create a webpage that would hypothetically take in a order for a t-shirt and would relay the size, color, and image to a database. My teacher also brought in a period of time where we worked with MySQL before he got disctracted and the whole project was scrapped.
